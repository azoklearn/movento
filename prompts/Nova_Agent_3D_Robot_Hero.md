# Prompt: Nova Agent, light 3D robot landing page

Build a single-file **three-section landing page** for a fictional on-chain AI agent product, **NOVA AGENT** ("Thinking Machines"). Use plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JS, plus **three.js 0.160.0** as an ES module through an import map. There is no framework and no build step.

The page is warm paper-white with thin dark grid lines. A cute boxy white-ceramic robot is built entirely in three.js and stays fixed on a full-screen canvas behind the content:
- **Intro:** the robot stands on a charcoal pedestal with its head tilted.
- **Product:** the camera glides in to a close-up of the head.
- **Reviews:** the face screen swaps its two glowing eyes for a quote mark.

## Fixed chrome

- **Grid:** three 1px vertical guides at 17 %, 50 % and 83 % of the width (`--col: 17%`).
- **Top bar:** 30px tall, mono 11px.
  - Text: "**New:** Nova Agent V1 Is Here - The Home for On-chain AI Agents ↗", with a × at the right.
  - It slides up out of view (0.5s, `cubic-bezier(.6,0,.2,1)`) once the page scrolls past 40px, or when × is clicked.
- **Nav:** 52px tall, below the top bar (moves to top 0 when scrolled). Paper at 86 % with an 8px backdrop blur and a bottom hairline. Its grid columns are `17% 1fr 12% 17%`:
  - **Logo:** a 27px rounded-square outline (a C-shape) stroked with the orange→pink gradient, with two dark dots for eyes, then "NOVA AGENT" at 18px.
  - **Menu (mono 11px):** Solutions▾, Pricing, Learn▾, $NOVA▾, Community▾, Contact us.
  - **Pad cell:** "Nova Pad ↗", with hairlines on both sides.
  - **Button:** "•• LAUNCH NOVA", a 30px outlined mono button. A gradient border shows only along part of its top edge and down its left edge, cut with a clip-path.
- **Right rail:** fixed, vertically centred, 270px tall.
  - A column of 14 tiny dots.
  - A floating label with a small dial icon, reading INTRO, PRODUCT or REVIEWS. It slides to 0 %, 31 % or 62 % of the rail as each section becomes more than half visible (0.7s).
  - "≡ MENU" underneath.

## Section 1: Intro (100vh)

- **Prompt box:** left edge at 17 %, top 30 %, width 24.4 %.
  - A 42px square tab containing a bold serif “.
  - Below it a 1px outlined box (mono 11px uppercase, line height 1.45) with an auto-typing prompt and a blinking 6×11px block caret.
  - Small 7px rounded corner brackets sit just outside the box.
  - Under the box, the next prompt shows in faint ink.
  - **Typing:** 38ms per character. It holds 2.6s, deletes 2 characters per 14ms, waits 250ms, then types the next prompt. The prompts loop:
    1. "Create a smart contract for a token named NOVA on Ethereum."
    2. "Explain what a smart contract does in simple terms."
    3. "Audit this contract for reentrancy vulnerabilities."
    4. "What is the market sentiment on BTC today?"
- **Rule:** a hairline from the prompt box to the right guide, level with the top of the box.
- **Feature list:** under that rule, right-aligned to the 83 % guide, 23 % wide. Rows are 21px tall with hairline dividers and a dot at 18 % of each row:
  - DEVELOPMENT
  - MARKET ANALYSIS
  - AI TRADING
  - AND MUCH MORE (dim)
- **Bottom left:** "UNLEASH THE POWER OF" (mono 12px) sits above the headline.
  - The headline "**Thinking** / **Machines**" is `clamp(42px, 5.25vw, 92px)`, weight 400. Each line sits in its own box outlined with a 2px gradient border, with no fill.
  - "Thinking" is outlined orange→pink, with its bottom-right corner cut at 45°.
  - "Machines" is outlined amber→orange→pink.
- **Sub line:** "Your personal expert in all crypto & blockchain related topics." at 14.5px, bottom 3.6 %, left at 62 % + 18px so it stays clear of the pedestal.
- **Scroll link:** "SCROLL" plus a down-arrow inside corner brackets at the bottom right. The arrow bobs 4px every 2s.
- **Bottom rule:** a hairline from 50 % to the right edge at bottom 14 %.

## Section 2: Product (100vh)

- **Tab carousel:** a 74px strip near the top, starting at the 17 % guide.
  - It holds 10 tabs, each 33vw wide: a 68px number cell plus a label. The labels are:
    1. AI Chatbot
    2. NFT Generator
    3. Smart-contract generator
    4. Blockchain & market analytics
    5. AI Trading assistant
    6. Code auditor
    7. Chart & technical analysis
    8. Crypto news AI
    9. Smart-contract auditor
    10. AI Chatbot
  - Every 2.4s the strip slides one tab left (0.9s, `cubic-bezier(.65,0,.2,1)`).
  - The active tab gets a 1px frame and corner brackets with full-ink text. Later tabs stay at 14 % ink, and tabs that have passed fade out.
- **Headline (bottom left, `clamp(30px, 3.05vw, 54px)`):**
  - A mono "··" above.
  - "Your Gateway", in a 1px rounded outline box.
  - "To Web3 AI" underneath.

## Section 3: Reviews (100vh)

- **Header strip:** 60px tall, near the top, with a hairline under it.
  - "TSTMNL" and the number "01" inside a small bracket.
  - A 56px square avatar, a dot, then the name.
  - The role in dim mono.
- **Quote:** left, top 26 %, 23vw wide, `clamp(20px, 2.3vw, 40px)`, line height 1.19.
  - Under it, "Try for yourself (Click Here)", with a 1px rule on its left.
- **Arrows:** ← → at the bottom left. Clicking one fades the name, role and quote out (0.45s, 10px drop), swaps them, then fades them back in.
- **Ghost:** the next review shows as a 10 % ink ghost to the right of the 83 % guide.
- **Reviews (all fictional):**
  1. “Smart contract auditing has always been a bottleneck for our startups, Nova Agent solves this problem in seconds. (Ilan Brooks, Founder of Halden Capital)
  2. Nova Agent is a vital asset for Web3 investors, simplifying the research process effortlessly. (Rhea Okafor, Co-founder of Tessel Network)
  3. “The fastest way we have found to go from an idea to a deployable token contract. (Mara Elling, CTO at Northline Labs)
- **Footer:** 30vh, centred mono "NOVA AGENT · 2026".

## Reveal

Every block has class `.rv`: opacity 0 and translateY 26px. When its section first enters view (IntersectionObserver at .15), it eases in over 1s with `cubic-bezier(.2,.7,.2,1)`, staggered .1s, .2s, .3s and .4s.

### Materials

| Material | Settings |
|---|---|
| Shell | MeshPhysical `#eeebe6`, roughness .38, clearcoat .45 (roughness .3) |
| Shell light | `#f8f6f2`, roughness .34, same clearcoat |

| Deep dark | `#0f0f12` |
| Pedestal | `#2a2928`, roughness .9 |
| Ring | See below |

**Ring:** a 512px canvas conic gradient (pink #ff3d8b → coral #ff5a5f → orange #ff8a3d → amber #ffb347 → orange → coral → pink), used as both map and emissive map (emissive .22). Roughness .5, clearcoat .35.

### Build (units)

- **Head:** a group pivoting at y .78 (head centre at +.78 above the pivot).
  - Skull: rounded box 1.5 × 1.42 × 1.3, radius .2.
  - Dark back block: 1.28 × 1.14 × .9, set back. Scatter ~26 tiny dark "circuit" bars over its back and top.
  - Face ring: an extruded rounded-rect frame (outer 1.5 × 1.44, r .3; inner 1.08 × 1.02, r .2; depth .1; bevel .03) with the ring material, at z .6. Remap the UVs to the frame's bounds so the gradient wraps around it.
  - Bezel: an inner shell-light frame at z .62.
  - Screen: a rounded plate .9 × .84 at z .66. Glossy black with clearcoat 1, and the face canvas as its emissive map (intensity 1.6).
  - Ears: cylinder r .22 on both sides, with caps. On the right, a half-torus dark cable loops down.
- **Neck:** a dark cylinder.
- **Torso:** rounded box 1.22 × 1.12 × .92, r .24.
  - A shell-light chest-top slab.
  - Three small emissive LEDs on the chest: `#ff8a3d`, `#ff5a5f`, `#ff3d8b`.
  - Two dark vertical slots with dark half-torus lips above them.
  - A dark pelvis.
- **Arms:** at each shoulder a dark ball, a shell upper arm, a dark elbow ball, then a forearm group holding a shell-light hand block and a thumb. Shoulders splay out by ±.16 rad; forearms bend by -.35.
- **Legs:** a dark hip ball, a shell leg block, a dark ankle, and a shell-light foot.
- **Pedestal:** a 1.7 × 1.6 × 1.7 box under the feet (y -2.22) that receives shadows.

### Face canvas (512px)

- Black fill. White shapes with a white glow (shadowBlur 18).
- **Eyes:** two ellipses at (196, 262) and (316, 252), radius 30 × 38.
- **Blink:** every 2.5–5.5s the eyes squash vertically to 10 % and back over .18s.
- **Quote mode:** a single 560px "Arial Black" “ centred at (256, 400). When the mode changes, the new face fades in at +.05 alpha per frame.

## Motion

- **Scroll:** p = scrollY / innerHeight, clamped 0–2, smoothed by 8 % per frame. It blends three camera states with ease-in-out cubic:

| State | Camera z | Camera y | Look-at y | Body yaw | Head yaw / pitch / roll |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Intro | 11.6 | 1.1 | .55 | -.42 | -.6 / .16 / .22 (tilted, looking left) |
| Product | 6.9 | 1.95 | 1.72 | -.2 | -.06 / .04 / 0 (close-up on the head) |
| Reviews | Same as Product | | | | |

- The face switches to quote mode once smoothed p passes 1.55.
- On screens under 900px, camera z is multiplied by 1.25.
- **Pointer:** the normalised cursor, smoothed by 6 % per frame:
  - moves the camera ±.25 x and ∓.1 y,
  - adds .12 to body yaw,
  - adds .45 to head yaw and .18 to head pitch.
- **Idle:**
  - the body bobs ±.02 (sin 1.4t),
  - the head sways slightly (pitch sin .9t × .02, roll sin .7t × .02),
  - the arms swing gently (shoulder sin(1.4t + side) × .05, forearm × .06).

## Mobile (≤ 900px)

- **Hidden:** the outer guides, the menu, the pad cell, the rail, the feature list and the ghost.
- **Layout:**
  - The nav becomes logo + button.
  - The prompt box spans the width at top 18 %.
  - The headline and scroll link sit 16px from the edges.
- **Readability:** the robot fills the screen, so the headline boxes, the "UNLEASH" line, the sub line, the "Gateway" lines, the quote and "Try for yourself" get a paper backing at `rgba(239,236,230,.88)`.
