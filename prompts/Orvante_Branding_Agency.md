# Prompt: Orvante branding-agency page (three sections)

Build a single-file, three-section landing page for a fictional branding agency, **Orvante**. Use plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JS, with no framework and no build step. The look is a strict monochrome editorial layout. A light grey hero with a large black-and-white photo of an Asian man seen from behind is followed by a black manifesto section whose words fill from grey to white, then a bordered "Trusted by" panel with stat cards.
