Prompt: Meadowbell hero

Build a single-file landing hero for an animated kids' farming series, "Hollyoak's Plucky Sprout Squad", from a fictional studio, Meadowbell. Use plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JS, with no framework and no build step. The look is a sunny hand-painted anime (Ghibli-like) afternoon: a boy and his beagle lie on a grassy hillside looking up at a big blue sky full of cumulus clouds, with a green valley far off on the right.

Scene
• Plate: the whole scene is ONE 9:8 background image (2160×1920): https://d2ol7oe51mr4n9.cloudfront.net/user_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P/3ca5d10d-ea2f-4907-876f-33bde169469e.jpg
• Sky: a deep-to-light blue sky across the top 60%, with a tall cumulus cloud on the left, another on the right, and wispy streaks top-right.
• Hillside: the boy (messy brown hair, white shirt, blue shorts, hands behind his head) and a brown-and-white beagle lie at the left, looking up. Grass and wildflowers fill the bottom third, softly blurred at the very bottom.
• Motion: the scene moves only through a looping video of the same plate: https://d2ol7oe51mr4n9.cloudfront.net/user_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P/d2cb5bef-f92b-4e91-ae93-8dc6555e56ac.mp4 (960×960, 5s, muted, loops; first frame = last frame).
• The grass ripples in steady waves, daisies nod, the boy's hair and shirt flutter, the dog's ears lift, and the clouds drift right.
• The video was rendered square from the plate mirror-padded 120/1920 at the top and bottom. Lay it over the plate at 100% width, 112.5% height, top −6.25% so its middle sits exactly on the plate.
• Rule: nothing in the scene is drawn or animated in code.

Frame and scaling
• Frame: the hero is one 1440×1280 frame (9:8) that scales with the viewport width: --u = 100vw/1440, height 1280u. On a 1440×900 screen the headline, buttons and the boy and dog show first, and the chapters row sits just below the fold.
• Placement: every element below is placed in frame units.

Type and colour
• Display: Grandstander 900, a rounded, slightly bouncy display face, all white. It's used for the logo, the kicker, the headline and the section title.
• Everything else: Inter 400/500. Self-host the latin woff2 files.
• Colours: text is white with a soft blue shadow 0 4u 18u rgba(28,70,120,.28) on the headline. Button text green is #5b875c.

Layout (1440×1280 frame)
• Nav:
  • Logo: "Meadowbell" 29.5px with a small white two-leaf sprout icon, at (31, 23).

  • Subline: Inter 21.2px / 27px, three lines: "Learn the Ways of the Meadow with / Hollyoak's Plucky Sprout Squad! Each chapter is / packed with play, chores, and wonder."
  • Join us button: white pill, 144×59 at (550, 617), green 22px.

    • a vegetable garden with tomato stakes and a cottage: https://d2ol7oe51mr4n9.cloudfront.net/user_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P/cd2d844f-ae3f-4fa9-8067-b077530b6e71.webp
    • a boy and dog on a hill path among sheep above the sea: https://d2ol7oe51mr4n9.cloudfront.net/user_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P/48f5b97e-c27c-4afd-9427-eb35aebd1751.webp
    • a girl in a straw hat flying a kite on a breezy hill: https://d2ol7oe51mr4n9.cloudfront.net/user_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P/cde5384e-ce4d-423f-925a-451b779066e0.webp

Motion (UI only)
• Entrance, one Web Animations timeline, run once:
  • the logo, nav and Join us drop in
  • the kicker un-blurs
  • each headline line springs up out of a blur, 0.16s apart
  • then the subline, both buttons, the chapters title and link, and the three cards rise in turn
• Hover: the cards lift 8u and their art zooms to 1.05. The pills rise 2u, and the chevron nudges right.
• Reduced motion: no video and no transitions.

Phones (≤ 820px)
• Nav: compact, with the logo and Join us.
• Copy: stacked and centred in flow, with the headline at 51px.
• Chapters: a swipeable row of cards.
• Scene: the 9:8 plate and video sit in one 9:8 box sized to the hero's height and shifted so the boy and dog stay in view (left 18%, translateX(−18%)).

Acceptance check (1440×1280)
• The text, pills and cards sit at the coordinates above over the hillside scene.
• The grass visibly ripples, the boy's hair and the dog's ears move, and the clouds drift.
• The video lines up exactly with the still.
