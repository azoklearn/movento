# Bag Slots: Glass Slot-Machine Bag Reveal Story (exact recreation prompt)

Build a single-file, interactive, vertical 9:16 social-media story for a fictional bag brand, **LUNE**.

A young woman in a cropped indigo denim jacket stands against a grey studio wall. A frosted-glass panel floats across her chest, reading "L U N E". When you tap the glass, she reaches toward the camera with her hand, grabs the glass and pulls it down like a slot-machine lever. That plays from a real video clip.

The panel then becomes three slot reels of shoulder bags that spin with motion blur and stop one by one on three matching bags. Then:

1. The glass melts away and the two side bags slide out.
2. The centre bag grows over her chest.
3. The frame washes out to white and holds as a clean packshot (with swatches that recolour the bag).
4. Hard cut to a black card with the small "L U N E" wordmark.
5. Tapping it cuts her back to the start (hidden behind the black card) and she pulls again.

## 1. Page basics

- `<html lang="en">`, title `Bag Slots`, viewport `width=device-width,initial-scale=1`, charset utf-8.
- **Font (Google Fonts):** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600&display=swap`, with preconnects to `https://fonts.googleapis.com` and `https://fonts.gstatic.com` (crossorigin). The standalone version embeds the three latin woff2 faces as base64 `@font-face` rules instead of the link.
- **Variables:** `--ink:#16161a`, `--glass:rgba(255,255,255,.14)`, `--edge:rgba(255,255,255,.42)`.
- **Reset and base:**
  - Universal `box-sizing:border-box;margin:0;padding:0`.
  - `html,body` fill the height, `overflow:hidden`, background `#cfd0cf`.
  - body font `"Inter","Helvetica Neue",Arial,sans-serif`, ink colour, antialiased, `user-select:none`.

## 2. Assets (all URLs exact)

1. **Her clip (Kling 4.0 reference-to-video, 5.04 s, 24 fps, 1080×1920, no audio).** It was generated with our model image as the start and the original campaign's reach-and-pull segment as the motion reference.
   - She stands with her arms down.
   - She reaches up toward the camera with her right hand (screen left) at chest height and leans in.
   - About 1.72 s: she grabs an invisible panel.
   - About 2.05 s: she pulls it down.
   - She then straightens, puts her hands behind her back, tilts her head and waits.

2. **White bag cut-out (transparent PNG, 1:1):** an original small structured baguette shoulder bag in plain white leather, with a slim front flap, a small gold ring clasp and a thin curved single strap on gold rings. Front view, no logo.
   `https://images.higgs.ai/?default=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd8j0ntlcm91z4.cloudfront.net%2Fuser_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P%2Fhf_20261106_072459_3a7afc56-a581-4651-8e7e-756e12183786.png&w=900&q=88`

**Colours:**

| # | Name | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Lilac | `#b9a8ef` |
| 1 | Butter | `#f2dfa8` |
| 2 | Sage | `#8cc27a` |
| 3 | Tangerine | `#f29a52` |
| 4 | Rose | `#ee88b6` |
| 5 | Ink | `#3a3a44` |
| 6 | Sky | `#9ccff0` |

**One tinted bag (`.bag`):** a relative box holding two full-size layers:

- `.t`: background `var(--c)`, masked by the bag image (`mask: var(--m) center/contain no-repeat`, with a `-webkit-` prefix too).
- The white bag `<img>`: `object-fit:contain`, `mix-blend-mode:multiply`.

This turns the one white bag into any colour while keeping its leather shading.

## 3. Story canvas

- **Story `#story`:** absolutely centred (translate -50%,-50%), overflow hidden, background `#d4d5d3`.
  - On load and resize: `w = min(innerWidth, innerHeight·9/16)`, height `w·16/9`, and `font-size w/100` px, so **1em = 1% of the story width**.
- **Canvas `#cv`:** fills the story.
- **Hidden clip `<video id="pv" muted playsinline preload="auto" crossorigin="anonymous">`:** asset 1, 2×2px, opacity 0.
- **Frame cache:**
  - On `loadeddata`: `NF = round(duration·24)`, which is 121.
  - Draw frame 0 into a 720×1280 offscreen canvas immediately and store it as a JPEG blob (quality .9).
  - Then capture every frame with `requestVideoFrameCallback` while the clip plays once: `i = round(mediaTime·24)`, JPEG quality .88.
  - Fallback without rVFC: seek through `i/24` and grab on each `seeked`.
- **Canvas drawing:**
  - The backing store is the canvas's client size × `min(devicePixelRatio, 2)`.
  - `draw()` decodes the nearest cached frame to `want` with `createImageBitmap` and draws it cover-fitted.
- **play(to, ms):** a rAF tween of the playhead `head` from its current value to `to` over `ms`, setting `want = round(head)` each frame.
- **Recorder hook:** `window.__hero = {ready, settled}`. `ready` means at least NF-2 frames are cached; `settled` means the shown frame equals the nearest-to-want frame.

## 4. Glass slot panel

- **Panel `#panel`:** absolute at left and right 6%, top 37%, height 22%, radius 2.6em, `cursor:pointer`.
  - Background `linear-gradient(160deg, rgba(255,255,255,.22), rgba(255,255,255,.06) 55%, rgba(255,255,255,.12))`.
  - `backdrop-filter: blur(1.6em) saturate(1.25) brightness(1.06)`, with a `-webkit-` prefix.
  - Box-shadows: `0 0 0 .14em var(--edge) inset`, `0 1.6em 3.4em rgba(0,0,0,.18)` and `0 .25em 0 rgba(255,255,255,.35) inset`.
  - Transition: transform .6s `cubic-bezier(.3,1.4,.5,1)`, opacity .5s, filter .5s.
- **Faint grid (`:before`):** opacity .35. Two 0.4%-wide white lines at 33.3% and 66.7% (60% alpha) and a horizontal centre line (35% alpha).
- **Wordmark `.word`:** "LUNE", centred, white, Inter 500 at 4.2em, letter-spacing .62em (with matching text-indent), soft shadow.
  - When the panel gets `.used`, it fades out and its tracking widens to 1em.
- **Reels:** at inset `6% 4%`, a three-column grid with a 4% gap, hidden until `.used`.
  - Each reel: radius 1.6em, overflow hidden, masked with `linear-gradient(transparent, #000 18%, #000 82%, transparent)` so bags fade in and out at the top and bottom.
  - Each reel holds a `.strip` of cells, each one reel tall (`--ch`, measured), with a tinted bag scaled to 128%.
- **States:**
  - `.pull`: `translateY(2.2em) rotate(-.6deg) scale(.985)`, .35s `cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1)`.
  - `.clear`: no background, backdrop-filter or shadow, and the grid fades out.
  - `.gone`: opacity 0, `scale(.92)`, blur .6em.
- **Hint:** "Tap the glass to spin", centred at top 61.6%, white, Inter 500 at 2.7em, letter-spacing .24em, uppercase, soft shadow. It hides on the first spin.
- **Initial reels:** Lilac, Sage, Butter.

## 5. The pull and the spin

- **spin():** only from the idle state.
  1. If `head > .5`, cut her straight to frame 0 (never play backwards).
  2. Play the clip forward from 0 to NF-1 at real speed (5.04 s).
  3. At 1.72 s add `.pull` to the panel (her hand grabs it).
  4. At 2.05 s remove `.pull` and start the reels (her pull).
- **Reels:**
  - Every pull lands three of a kind, cycling the target through Sage, Butter, Lilac, Rose, Sky, Tangerine.
  - Each reel k builds a strip: its current colour, then `14 + 6k` random colours, then the target.
  - The strip gets blur .35em and animates translateY with `cubic-bezier(.2,.55,.3,1)` over `1200 + 420k` ms, fill forwards. Keyframes: 0 → `-(dist + .18·cell)` at 90% → `-(dist - .06·cell)` at 96% → `-dist`, giving an overshoot and bounce stop.
  - The blur is removed at `900 + 420k` ms.
  - On finish, collapse the strip to the single result cell. When all three have stopped, run the jackpot.

## 6. Jackpot ending (as in the original campaign film)

All times are relative to the third reel stopping.

- **+450ms:**
  - Left reel: `translateX(-80%)` with opacity → 0.
  - Right reel: `translateX(80%)` with opacity → 0.
  - Both run 600ms with `cubic-bezier(.5,0,.75,0)`, fill forwards.
  - The panel gets `.clear`, so the glass melts away and the centre bag stays.
- **+1150ms:**
  - Create `#big`, a tinted bag box sized S = 80% of the story width, centred horizontally, with its centre at 47% of the story height.
  - Measure the centre reel's bag rectangle and animate `#big` from that position and scale (`translate(dx, dy) scale(cellW/S)`) to none over 760ms with `cubic-bezier(.55,0,.2,1)`, fill backwards.
  - The panel gets `.gone`.
- **+1700ms:** the white overlay `#white` (full story, `#fff`) animates opacity 0 → 1 over 650ms ease-in-out, fill forwards. It sits above her and below the bag, so the frame washes to white around the bag.
- **+2350ms:** the packshot state.
  - `#pack` fades in at bottom 14% (column, 3.2em gap).
  - A row of seven 5em colour swatches (gap 2.4em, white ring; the active one gets an extra ink ring; hover scale 1.14).
  - Under them, "The Lune Bag · Sage" (the active colour name) at 2.5em, letter-spacing .42em, uppercase, `#8a8a8f`.
  - Tapping a swatch recolours the big bag (.5s colour transition) and gives a little swing: rotate 4° → -2.5° → 0 around 50% 8%, 600ms.
- **End card:** reached by tapping the packshot outside the swatches, by Space, or automatically after 2.8 s idle.
  - A hard cut to `#end`: full black, with "LUNE" centred in white Inter 500 at 3.2em, letter-spacing .7em.
  - "Tap to spin again" at bottom 10%, 2.3em, letter-spacing .3em, uppercase, `#6d6d72`.
- **Restart:** from a tap on the end card, Space, or automatically after 2.6 s idle. While the card is still black:
  1. Hide the pack and big bag, cancel the white overlay and reel animations, and restore the panel.
  2. Cut her to frame 0 and wait until it is drawn.
  3. Then hide the black card, return to idle, and pull again after 350ms.

## 7. Controls and autoplay

- **Tap the glass:** spin.
- **Space:** spin, or advance from the packshot to the end card, or from the end card to a restart.
- **Autoplay:** waits until the clip is fully cached, then repeats the loop on its own, in this order:
  - Idle for 4.2 s: spin.
  - Packshot after 2.8 s: end card.
  - End card after 2.6 s: restart.
- Any pointer movement resets the idle timer.
