# Leon Vasari: Curved VHS Archive (exact recreation prompt)

Give me the superdetailed exact prompt to recreate this page exactly as it is, including the correct asset URL, all elements, animations, and fonts. This is that prompt.

## What it is

Build a single-screen **film archive hero** for a fictional director, Leon Vasari. Use plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript in one file, with no framework and no libraries.

The page is warm off-white paper.
- **The shelf:** across the middle, worn VHS tapes stand on a **curved arc that recedes into depth**. Spines get smaller, darker and more tightly packed toward both edges, about 11 per side. They turn slightly toward the centre and sit lower as they go back, like a shelf bent into a shallow bowl.
- **The active tape:** the tape at the centre is **turned 90° in 3D** so its illustrated front cover faces you, pushed slightly forward, over a soft floor shadow.
- **Background:** two columns of giant halftone kanji, **映画** on the left and **の記憶** on the right, sit behind the shelf.
- **Caption:** under the cover, the film's title is set big and bold in cobalt, with its romanised and kanji titles, a short rule and "YEAR — GENRE". Arrows sit on either side.
- **Timeline:** a ruler from 1955 to 1990 runs along the bottom. A cobalt dot glides to the active film's year.
- **Detail sheet:** clicking the cover grows a sheet of paper out of it into a full-screen detail page. Its poster bleeds in like ink.

Everything runs on one `requestAnimationFrame` loop plus the Web Animations API. There are no opacity fades: every reveal is a mask slide, a clip or a scale.

## Media: every asset URL

All 24 images come from **four Higgsfield GPT Image 2.5 sheets** with transparent backgrounds, loaded through the Higgsfield image proxy as WebP. The art is fictional, unbranded VHS art. Each spine and cover is a rectangle cropped out of a sheet with CSS backgrounds; there are no separate image files.

**What the art looks like:**
- **Spines** (about 1:6): worn cardboard, a small illustration at the top, the title vertical in a condensed serif, then "VASARI" and a boxed "VHS".
- **Covers** (about 1:1.95): "A LEON VASARI FILM" at the top, a big condensed serif title, a duotone screen-print illustration in ink, cobalt, vermilion and cream, and a "VHS" badge.

Crop boxes are in sheet pixels, `x, y, w, h`:

**Cropping:**
- Store the tables as `SHEET[id] = [url, W, H]` and `CROP['spine-<id>'|'cover-<id>'] = [sheet, x, y, w, h]`.
- A face's background is `background-image:url(sheet); background-size:(W/w·100)% (H/h·100)%; background-position:(x/(W−w)·100)% (y/(H−h)·100)%`.
- **Detail poster:** an SVG `<image>` of the sheet with `x=−x·474/w`, `y=−y·900/h`, `width=W·474/w`, `height=H·900/h` and `preserveAspectRatio="none"`, clipped to a 474 × 900 rect.
- Preload the four sheets as `Image()` objects on start.

## Fonts (all embedded as base64 WOFF2)

Render the 12 films three times (36 tapes, virtual index `v = copy×12 + i`). Start at `s = T = 5 + 12`.

## Arc geometry (the core of this design)

### Measured values
Measure H with a probe element of `height:var(--H)`. Then:
- `ws = H·142/840`, `d = H·474/900`, `gap = H·.035`
- `U = H·1.3` on desktop, `H·1.05` below 768px (the depth falloff)
- `P = 1400` (the CSS perspective)

### Functions
- **Relative index:** `rel(v,s) = ((v−s) mod 36)` mapped into [−18, 18).
- **Arc length from the centre:** `F(r) = r·(ws+gap) + (d − ws + 1.4·gap)·B(r)`, where `B(r) = (r + sin(πr)/π)/2` for |r| < 1 and `±.5` otherwise. The open cover pushes its neighbours apart smoothly.
- **Screen scale at arc length u:** `scl(u) = 1/(1 + (|u|/U)^1.6)`.
- **Screen x:** the integral of `scl`. Precompute `XS` by stepping u from 0 to 3U in 2px steps, accumulating `2/(1+(u/U)^1.6)`. Then `xsc(u) = sign(u)·XS[|u|/2]`. Far spines pack tighter in screen space.

### Per tape, every frame
- `o = smoothstep(max(0, 1−|r|))`: 0 for a spine, 1 for the open cover.
- `u = F(r)`. If `|u| > U·1.95`, hide the tape.
- `sc = scl(u)` and `k = 1/sc`. The tape sits at the depth that gives this on-screen scale:
  - `z = P·(1−k) + o·H·.1`
  - `x = xsc(u)·k`
  - `y = (H·.5·(1−sc)·.42 + o·H·.012 − lift·H·.05)·k`, so far tapes sink a little, forming the bowl.
- `rotateY = sign(u)·min(1,|u|/U)·26°·(1−o) − 90°·o + tiltY·o`, and `rotateX = tiltX·o`.
- Transform: `translate3d(x,y,z) rotateX() rotateY()`. z-index `round(3000+z)`.
- **Shading:** the spine's `--shade` is `min(.6, o·.55 + (1−sc)·.32)`, so far spines darken. The cover's `--shade` is `(1−o)·.82`.
- **Hover lift:** a hovered non-active tape (`|r| > .5`) eases its lift to 1 at `1−e^(−12dt)`.

### Motion
- **Spring:** `s += (T−s)·(1−e^(−k·dt))`, with k = 5.2, or 18 while dragging. `dt` is capped at 50ms. When `s` passes ±4 loops, shift `s` and `T` by whole loops.
- **Active film:** `round(s) mod 12`. On change, swap the caption with `dir = sign(T−s)`.
- **Timeline dot:** interpolate the year between the films at `floor(s)` and `floor(s)+1`. On the 1989 → 1958 wrap, jump at the halfway point. It eases at `1−e^(−14dt)` and jumps directly when more than 6 years away. Left is `(year−1955)/35`.
- **Cover tilt:**
  - The pointer is "on the cover" when it is within `.55d` of the screen centre and `.55H` of the shelf centre, the shelf has settled (`|T−s| < .3`) and the detail is closed.
  - On the cover: `tiltY → (mx−W/2)/(.55d)·8°` and `tiltX → −(my−cy)/(H/2)·5°`.
  - Elsewhere: `tiltY → (mx−W/2)/W·4°` and `tiltX → 0`.
  - Both ease at `1−e^(−7dt)`.
- **Play ring scale:** `smoothstep(max(0, 1−|T−s|·3))`, or 0 while the detail is open.

### Inputs
- **Click a tape:** the active one opens the detail; any other glides to `round(T + r)`. Clicks are ignored after a drag.
- **Arrows and keys:** arrows and ←/→ step ±1. Enter opens, Escape closes.
- **Drag:** `T = T0 − dx/(ws+gap)` once moved more than 5px. Release snaps to the nearest integer.
- **Wheel:** `T += delta/(ws+gap)·.5`, using the larger axis, then snaps after 160ms idle. It is ignored while the detail is open.
- **Timeline click:** convert x to a year and jump to the film with the nearest year by the shortest way round.

## Caption swap (mask slide)

- A new span is appended over the old one inside the mask.
- The new span slides from `translateY(dir·105%)` to 0.
- Each old span slides from its current transform to `translateY(−dir·105%)` and is then removed.
- Timing: 650ms, `cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1)`, `fill both`.

## Detail sheet

**Structure:** a fixed full-screen `.detail` in `--sheet`, z 60, hidden until opened.
- **Grid:** two columns with a 4vw gap and padding `110px 6vw 56px 7vw`.
- **Close button:** a boxed `.lbl` "CLOSE / 閉じる" at 36px, 28px.
- **Brand:** a cobalt copy of the brand ("LEON VASARI —— FILM ARCHIVE") top right.

**Left column:** centred vertically, max 520px, 18px gap. Every line sits in its own mask:
1. The cobalt subtitle `.lbl`.
2. The title in Inter Tight 600, `clamp(44px,5.2vw,80px)`, letter-spacing −.03em, cobalt.
3. The muted meta line `YEAR / GENRE / N min`.
4. The synopsis in Newsreader 17px/1.5, max 42ch.
5. The italic muted credit "Written and directed by Leon Vasari. 監督作品".
6. A 44px cobalt-bordered button "WATCH THE FILM / 映画を見る".

**Right column:** the poster SVG (viewBox 474 × 900, height `min(100%,78vh)`).
- **Image:** the cover crop, masked by seven white circles in a group.
- **Ink filter on that group:** `feTurbulence` fractalNoise, baseFrequency .011, 3 octaves, seed 7, into `feDisplacementMap` with scale 120 (R/G channels).
- **Circles** (cx, cy, delay ms): (150,330,0) (340,600,120) (250,120,220) (90,760,300) (400,250,360) (260,860,420) (230,470,180).

**Open:**
1. Snap T, fill in the texts, aim the poster image, and reset the radii to 0.
2. Read the cover face's projected `getBoundingClientRect`.
3. Animate the sheet's `clip-path` from `inset(top right bottom left round 3px)` (the cover rect) to `inset(0 round 0)` over **1050ms** with `cubic-bezier(.76,0,.18,1)`. A blank rectangle of paper grows straight out of the cover to fill the screen.
4. The text lines rise from `translateY(110%)` over 900ms, with delays of `620 + i·75` ms.
5. From 520ms, each circle grows from 0 to r = 720 over 1250ms after its delay (ease-out cubic). The poster bleeds in as ragged ink blots.

**Close:** the reverse clip back to the current cover rect over 850ms, then hide the sheet and cancel its animations.

## Phones (≤ 767px)
- `--H:min(68vw,40svh)` and `--cy:43%`.
- **Top bar:** 60px, 16px padding. The nav text is hidden (the burger stays) and the brand line is 22px.
- **Kanji:** 22vw at .8 opacity.
- **Caption:** the title is 27px. The arrows drop to bottom 118px at the screen edges.
- **Timeline:** 16px sides, bottom 54px, and every other year label is hidden.
- **Detail:** one scrolling column with the poster first at 46svh and a 42px title.
- No custom cursor; finger drag scrubs the shelf.

## Reduced motion
- The spring and lift are instant.
- Captions swap without sliding.
- The sheet and text animations take 1ms.
- The ink starts 5s in the past, so the poster shows at once.
