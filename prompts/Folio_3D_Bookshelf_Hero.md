# Prompt: Folio, 3D bookshop hero with a rising row of books

Give me the superdetailed exact prompt to recreate this page exactly as it is, including the correct asset URLs, all elements, animations and fonts. This is that prompt.

## What it is

Build a single-screen hero for a fictional independent press and bookshop, **Folio**. Use one HTML file with plain HTML and CSS plus a Three.js module (r160 from jsDelivr through an import map: `three` and `three/addons/`).

- **Page:** pure black, with a giant thin high-contrast serif wordmark "Folio" across the upper middle.
- **Books:** a long diagonal row of 32 real 3D hardcover books stands on edge, running from the bottom-right corner off the left edge, covers facing the camera at a slight angle and heavily overlapping.
- **Covers:** every book wears its own fully designed cover.
- **Wave:** books near the cursor rise in a smooth, springy wave, with neighbours tapering off. Raised books pass in front of the wordmark.
- **Smoothness:** every book has its own spring, sub-stepped each frame, so the motion stays smooth at any frame rate.

## Media: every asset URL

The covers come from two Higgsfield GPT Image 2.5 sheets (2336 × 1744 px each), 6 columns × 3 rows of 2:3 covers separated by black gutters. Load them through the Higgsfield image proxy, which sends `access-control-allow-origin: *` so they can be WebGL textures:

- **sheetA:** https://images.higgs.ai/?default=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd8j0ntlcm91z4.cloudfront.net%2Fuser_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P%2Fhf_20261030_003447_7862e2d0-751c-4d7c-9c8a-e682415d908f.png&w=2336&q=90
- **sheetB:** https://images.higgs.ai/?default=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd8j0ntlcm91z4.cloudfront.net%2Fuser_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P%2Fhf_20261030_003448_95f1eed5-2ae5-4736-a53c-f3b3f87acd3b.png&w=2336&q=90

All titles and authors are fictional. Each cover is a texture clone of its sheet:

- Trim 3px from every side to drop the gutter.
- `repeat = ((w−6)/2336, (h−6)/1744)`, `offset = ((x+3)/2336, 1 − (y+h−3)/1744)`.
- `colorSpace = SRGBColorSpace`, `anisotropy = max`.

**Order:** books use cover index n (0 to 17 from sheet A, 18 to 35 from sheet B) in this order, front to back:

`0, 22, 5, 30, 9, 13, 26, 2, 19, 11, 33, 7, 15, 24, 4, 28, 17, 21, 1, 31, 14, 8, 25, 35, 3, 18, 10, 29, 16, 23, 6, 34`

## Fonts and colour

- **Fonts:** Google Fonts **Libre Caslon Display** 400 for the wordmark and logo, **Inter** 400 and 500 for the UI.
- **Colours:** background `#000`, text white. The logo mark is a `#b8a58a` rounded tile with a `#16120d` bar. The pill is white with black text.

## Layout (all fixed, the page never scrolls)

### Nav (z 5)

- **Box:** left 23.3vw, right 23.4vw, top 4.6vh, height 4.4vh; font `max(11px, .78vw)` Inter 500.
- **Logo:**
  - A 2.1vw × 2.4vw tile with a dark vertical bar (left 32%, 24% wide, 64% tall).
  - Next to it, "Folio" in Libre Caslon Display `max(17px, 1.55vw)`, with "independent press" in Inter `max(8px, .6vw)` at 70% under it.
- **Centre links**, 2.3vw apart, starting 11.4vw after the logo: "Books ⌄", "Authors", "Journal", "More ⌄". The chevrons are small stroked svgs, and the links sit at 88% opacity, going to 100% on hover.
- **Right side**, 2.4vw apart:
  - "Sign in".
  - A white pill "Start reading": radius .4vw, padding .55vw 1vw, lifting 1px on hover.

### Wordmark (z 1)

- **Text:** "Folio", centred, `--fs: min(46vh, 32vw)`, `font: 400 var(--fs)/1 Libre Caslon Display`, letter-spacing −.02em.
- **Position:** `top: calc(46.5vh − var(--fs)·.8)`, so its baseline sits at about 46vh.

### Link row (z 1)

- **Box:** top 51.1vh, centred, gap 2.1vw, Inter 500 `max(10px, .74vw)`.
- **Links:** "New Releases, Bestsellers, Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, Classics, Independent Voices, Gift Cards".

### Canvas (z 2)

A full-screen transparent WebGL canvas above the wordmark and links and below the nav.

## Three.js scene

### Renderer

- `antialias`, `alpha`, pixel ratio `min(dpr, 2)`.
- ACESFilmic tone mapping at exposure 1.05, sRGB output.

### Lighting

- **Environment:** `PMREMGenerator.fromScene(new RoomEnvironment(), .04)` with `environmentIntensity .55`.
- **Key:** DirectionalLight `#fff3e4`, 2.4, at (−4, 6, 6).
- **Rim:** `#bfd2ff`, 1.1, at (6, 3, −4).
- **Ambient:** white, .12.

### Camera

- PerspectiveCamera with fov 19.5 (40 when width < height) at (3.6, 2.15, 7.4), looking at (−1.4, .05, −.6).

### Books

- **Geometry:** one shared `BoxGeometry(1, 1.5, .2)`. Face materials in order +x, −x, +y, −y, +z, −z:
  1. **Fore-edge:** MeshStandard, roughness .9, with a 256px canvas of cream `#efe7d6` and 1px brown lines every 2px (alpha .05 to .17), horizontal.
  2. **Spine:** MeshPhysical in the cover's spine colour ×.62, roughness .55, clearcoat .3.
  3. **Top** and 4. **Bottom:** the same page texture with vertical lines.
  5. **Cover:** MeshPhysical with the cover texture, roughness .42, clearcoat .55, clearcoatRoughness .35.
  6. **Back:** spine colour ×.62, roughness .6.
- **Groups:** each book is a mesh inside a group.
  - Group position: `(1.55 + i·(−.5), −1.12, .9 + i·(−.2))` with `rotation.y = .32`, where i = 0 is the front book at the bottom right.
  - The mesh moves inside the group for the lift.

## Motion

### Pointer wave

- **Projection:** each frame, project the point (0, .1, 0) of each book mesh to screen pixels (sx, sy).
- **Influence:** with `s = max(innerWidth, innerHeight)·.085`, `influence = exp(−((sx−x)² + ((sy−y)·.55)²) / s²)`.
- **Target lift:** `.78·influence`, or 0 when the pointer has left the window or the window is blurred.

### Springs

Every book has a vertical spring and a forward spring (target `lift·.35` in local z), both with `K = 70`, `C = 12.5`.

- Integrate in 4 sub-steps per frame, with `dt` capped at .05s: `v += ((target − y)·K − v·C)·h; y += v·h`.
- `mesh.rotation.x = −v·.012`, so a book leans slightly while it moves.

### Intro

- **Books:** start at y = −3. Each one's target stays −3 until `t > .25 + (32 − i)·.035` seconds, so the row rises from the back to the front, each book springing up.
- **Wordmark:** Web Animations API, 1400ms after a 150ms delay: opacity 0 → 1, translateY(4vh) → 0, blur(14px) → 0, with `cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1)`.
- **Nav:** fades down from −1.2vh at 700ms (900ms long).
- **Link row:** fades up from 1.2vh at 850ms (900ms long).

### Touch and idle

On `(pointer: coarse)`, or after 4s without pointer movement, a virtual cursor sweeps along the row with `u = (sin(t·.45) + 1)/2`, between book 29 and book 1 projected to the screen.

## Phones (≤760px)

- **Nav:** left and right 5vw, top 2.5vh. Only the logo and the pill stay.
- **Wordmark:** `--fs: 36vw` at top 14vh.
- **Link row:** wraps at top 36vh with 8vw side padding.
- **Camera:** fov 40.
